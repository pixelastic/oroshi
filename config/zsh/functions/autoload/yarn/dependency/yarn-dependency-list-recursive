# Display a raw table of ALL dependencies of the project, recursively including
# subdependencies
#
# This list is consumed by the autocomplete of commands like "yarn why"
# Usage:
# $ yarn-dependency-all-list-raw              # Only regular dependencies
function yarn-dependency-list-recursive() {
	# Explanation:
	# - We read yarn.lock but only keep the header lines
	#   - We remove lines starting with a space
	#   - We remove comments
	#   - We remove empty lines
	# - We ditch everything after the first @, to only keep package name
	# - We ditch starting quotes
	# - We deduplicate
	grep -vE '^( |#|$)' yarn.lock |
		sed \
			-e 's/@.*//' \
			-e 's/^"//' |
		uniq
}
