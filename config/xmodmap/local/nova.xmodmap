! The Fn key is on the far left, with the Ctrl one just next to it. I'm used
! (from previous keyboards) to have these two swapped. So I swapped them.
! I'm used to having Home/End keys near my arrow keys for speed movement, so
! I remapped the PageUp/PageDown. I also mapped the original Home/End keys
! (situated in the top right of the keyboard) to PageUp/PageDown
