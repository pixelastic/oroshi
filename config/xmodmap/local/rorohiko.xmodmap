! The Fn key is on the far left, with the Ctrl one just next to it. I'm used
! (from previous keyboards) to have these two swapped. So I swapped them.
! I'm used to having Home/End keys near my arrow keys for speed movement, so
! I remapped the PageUp/PageDown. I also mapped the original Home/End keys
! (situated in the top right of the keyboard) to PageUp/PageDown
keycode 112 = Home
keycode 117 = End
keycode 110 = Prior
keycode 115 = Next

!!!!! Enter key
! The key is named "Entr√©e" on french keyboard but is in fact a Return key.
! It produces a Carriage Return on press (default)
! It also produces a "Numeric Keypad" Enter on Shift-Press (custom)
keycode  36 = Return KP_Enter Return KP_Enter
