! Notes:
!   Each physical (plastic) key on a keyboard has its own keycode, a number
!   between 1 and 255. Some keycode will be shared accross various types of
!   keyboards while other might change (think azerty/qwerty differences,
!   Windows or Mac special keys and multimedia keyboards)
!
!   Most of the keycodes are directly linked to a characters (a-z). Some other
!   do not print anything at all (F1-F12) while others acts as modifiers.
!   A modifier does not print anything either but change the meaning of
!   another key pressed at the same time (think of Shift for capital letters)
!
!   Xmodmap uses an inner representation of these keys, using keysyms. We can
!   bind a specific keycode (for example 36) to a specific keysym (for example
!   the <Return> action).
!
!   There is a maximum of 8 different modifiers that can be applied to a key.
!   Those modifiers are passed, along with the key, to the underlying software
!   that can react accordingly.
!
!   Several modifiers can be send at the same time, but there is usually no
!   more than 2 at the same time.
!   The 3 more common modifiers are : Shift, Control and Lock.
!     Shift is used to make the next char uppercase
!     Control is used to bind some keyboard shortcuts
!     Lock is pressed once and all subsequent chars are uppercased
!   There are 5 more modifiers available, named mod1-5. They are not as widely
!   supported as the first 3 so there is no real standard on what they should
!   do, but the common practice is as follow :
!     Mod1 is usually used as the "Alt" modifier key
!     Mod2 is usually used as a Lock on the Numeric keyboard
!     Mod3 is almost never used
!     Mod4 is usually the "Meta" (Windows) key
!     Mod5 is usually the AltGr (Alternate Graphics) key
!
!   Lastly, xmodmap allows you to remap any keycode to up to 6 keysyms,
!   depending on the modifier keys pressed (normal, Shift, Mode_Switch,
!   Shift+Mode_Switch, ISO_Level3_Shift, Shift+ISO_Level3_Shift).
!
!   The ISO_Level3_Shift is usually found on European keyboards and allow
!   access to Alternate Graphics through the AltGr key. The Mode_Switch can be
!   thought as a 'ISO_Level2_Shift'.
