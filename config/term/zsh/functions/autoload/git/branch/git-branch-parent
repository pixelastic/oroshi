# Return the closest parent branch of the current branch
# In other words: the nearest commit that resides on another branch, and what
# branch is that?
# Usage:
# $ git-branch-parent
# shellcheck disable=SC2178
function git-branch-parent() {
  # We get the list of all "decorations", ie branchnames and tags, and then
  # massage it until we get the name of the second closest decoration

  local result="$(git log --format=%d)" # We start with the full list
  result=(${(f)result})                 # We turn it into an array, with newlines as separators. This removes empty lines
  result="$(echo $result[2] | xargs)"   # We trim the second line
  result=${result:1:-1}                 # We remove the wrapping parenthesis
  result=(${(@s/, /)result})            # We split on commas
  result=$result[1]                     # We keep the first element
  echo $result
}
