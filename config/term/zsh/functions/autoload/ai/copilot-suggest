# Suggest how to write a command
# Usage:
#   $ copilot-suggest 'list all files bigger than 10MB'   # Output the command
#
# Note: As of November 2023, gh copilot has a nicer output than sgpt, but
# requires manual interactivity, so I will still be using ai-shell-suggest
# instead
function copilot-suggest() {
	local args="$@"
	gh copilot suggest $args
}
