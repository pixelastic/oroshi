# Documentation and code examples

I want to have working code examples and up-to-date information

- **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP FIRST** when dealing with code examples, setup, configuration and library/API documentation

# Task Master

I want to use Task Master to organize my big projects into a list of small tasks

- Use Task Master AI MCP server when dealing with a list of things to do
- Do not add zsh aliases, nor init a git repository when setting up Task Master

# Coding Style

Keep a consistent coding style matching my preferences across my projects

- Don't suggest scripts in python. Prefer scripts in zsh or in JavaScript
- Prefer camelCase for variables, functions, directories, files, etc (unless that specific language/project has a strong opinion against it)
- Prefer to "return early" in functions if conditions are not met, rather than putting most of the code in a condition
- Prefer a DX that makes simple things easy and complex things possible
