# Documentation and code examples

I want to have working code examples and up-to-date information

- **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP FIRST** when dealing with code examples, setup, configuration and library/API documentation

# Coding Style

Keep a consistent coding style matching my preferences across my projects

- Don't suggest scripts in python. Prefer scripts in zsh or in JavaScript
- Prefer camelCase for variables, functions, directories, files, etc (unless that specific language/project has a strong opinion against it)
- Prefer to "return early" in functions if conditions are not met, rather than putting most of the code in a condition
- Prefer a DX that makes simple things easy and complex things possible

# Dependencies

If you need to check how some dependencies are working, you can find there on
disk:
- aberlaas: /home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas
- firost: /home/tim/local/www/projects/firost

# Debug

If you need to create scripts for debugging:
- Create them in /home/tim/local/tmp/claude
- Create one subdirectory per conversation
