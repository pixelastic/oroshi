# Documentation and code examples

I want to have working code examples and up-to-date information

- **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP FIRST** when dealing with code examples, setup, configuration and library/API documentation

# CLI tooling

I don't want my custom aliases to get in the way of your parsing of commands.

- When using Tools, always use the escaped version of the common commands, like `\grep`, `\cat`, `\ls`, to avoid using my custom aliases

# Task Master

I want to use Task Master to organize my big projects into a list of small tasks

- Use Task Master AI MCP server when dealing with a list of things to do
- Do not add zsh aliases, nor init a git repository when setting up Task Master

# Coding Style

Keep a consistent coding style matching my preferences across my projects

- Prefer camelCase for variables, functions, directories, files, etc (unless that specific language/project has a strong opinion against it)
- Don't suggest scripts in python. Prefer scripts in zsh or in JavaScript
