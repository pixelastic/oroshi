# DEPRECATED

This `vit` repository has been deprecated.

I've now moved all my git-related scripts directly into my dotfiles repo.

Submodules in git are a pain, I'd rather have everything under the same repo.
Also, as it was becoming highly dependent on the colors and icons I defined in
my dotfiles, this repo couldn't work as a standalone anyway.
