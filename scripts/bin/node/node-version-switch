# By default, I have the node binaries of the default version loaded
# If I do a nvm use of another version, it adds this version binaries to my path
# I might not have yarn installed, so I need to add it
#
# Also add a node-version-install? That install the node version, and yarn
# This should already be the case with default-packages though
