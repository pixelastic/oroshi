#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Play an audio file
# Note: This is a binary and not a zsh function because I might need tools (like
# kitty, or keybindings) to use it without having the whole zsh stuff loaded
#
# Usage:
# $ audio-play ./path/to/file.mp3    # "Hello World!"
local input="$1"

# "&>/dev/null &" and "disown" allow running the command fully in the background
ffplay \
  -nodisp \
  -autoexit \
  -loglevel quiet \
  $1 &>/dev/null &
disown
