# Globally install a yarn package
#
# Yarn is managed through nvm, but by default:
# - Installs global code to ~/.config/yarn/global (`yarn global dir`)
# - Installs binary syminks to ~/.yarn/bin (`yarn global bin`)
#
# As we'll have one yarn installation per node version, we need to keep separate
# store of global packages as well.
#
# This can be achieved through yarn flags:
# --prefix defines where the main node installation is
# --global-folder defines where to store the global packages code
#
# Note: This is defined as a script in ./bin instead of as a zsh autoloaded
# function as it is used in install scripts, where zsh functions might not be
# available.
#
# Usage:
# $ yarn-global-add eslint_d   # Install into the current node version as selected by nvm

# Stop if no package given
[[ $1 == "" ]] && exit 1

# Find the path the current node version
# This assumes that node has been installed through nvm
