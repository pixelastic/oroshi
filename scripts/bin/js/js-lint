#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# Write a zsh script that:
# - takes one js file as arguments
# - accepts an optional --json parameter
#
# Check where is located the input file by running "yarn-root --force". This
# will give the path to the project root (where the package.json is)
#
# We then check if there is an eslint config file there (either eslint.config.js
# or .eslintrc.js).
#
# - If it has such a config, it use it. Otherwise it should fallback to the
# config in ~/.oroshi/eslint.config.js
#
# It should then run eslint_d on that file, with that config.
# If --json is passed, it should output the results in json format.
