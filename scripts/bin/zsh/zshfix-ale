#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Wrapper of zshfix to be used by ALE in vim
# Usage:
# $ zshfix-ale -filename=file.zsh < tmpfile.zsh  # As called by ALE

# ALE passes the filepath as the -filename= argument, and the content through
# stdin.
# We convert the filepath as a regular argument and discard stdin
local input=""
for arg in $@; do
	if [[ $arg == -filename=* ]]; then
		input=${arg:10}
		break
	fi
done

# ALE expect the result to be output, so we apply zshfix on a temporary copy of
# the file
local uuid="$(md5 ${input:a})"
local tmpFile="${OROSHI_TMP_FOLDER}/zshfix/${uuid}.zsh"
rm -f ${tmpFile}
mkdir -p ${tmpFile:h}
cp ${input:a} ${tmpFile}

# If the fix is successful, we display the content
zshfix ${tmpFile} && cat ${tmpFile}
