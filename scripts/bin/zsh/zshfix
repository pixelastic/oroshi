# Fix a zsh file in place
# Usage:
# $ zshfix file.zsh   # Format the file
# $ zshfix ./*.zsh    # Format several files
#
# This is a wrapper around shfmt and beautysh. None of those tools actually
# support zsh.
# - shfmt is very powerful, but chokes on some zsh-specific syntax
# (most notably variable modifiers) and refuse to format a file that contains
# them.
# - beautysh is slower and does way less things, but doesn't seem to mind
# zsh-specific syntax.
#
# So we'll try shfmt, and if it fails, fallback on beautysh
