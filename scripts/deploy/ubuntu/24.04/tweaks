# Update generic Ubuntu config, for a better usage suited to my preference.
# This will do small things like remove the key repeat delay, enable dark mode,
# or the orange color filter, etc.
#
# The best way to know which values to update is to run dconf-watch, then to
# change values in the Settings UI, then save it here, so I only have to run
# this script later to find my config back.

# Disable Dock on the left side
